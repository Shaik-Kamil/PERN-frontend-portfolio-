            Iâ€™m currently a FullStack web Development Fellow at Pursuit which is
            an intensive 12 month FullStack web development fellowship where I
            am upskilling/ reskilling to break into tech. I have always been the
            person who loves solving complex problems and breaking them down.
            Since I have always been an avid lifelong learner, Software
            Engineering felt like the next natural and logical step career-wise.

            Prior to this, I have experience in various roles all in one way or
            another that involve Operations Management, whether its my recent
            experience as a warehouse operations lead where I was in charge of
            both day to day operations as well as personnel management. I have
            worn many hats in this role such as customer service support, vendor
            management, delivery partners management and logistics management
            among many others. Looking back on my past work experiences, I have
            demonstrated an agile and quick adaptability to new roles and
            industries while successfully exceeding expectations.
